     Packager     Version: VB14.6.0.11

     The PDBs listed in the project file will be searched to satisfy the parts
      requirements of the CDB and to overwrite any duplicates found in the
      Target PDB.

     All existing reference designators and frozen properties will be
      ignored during packaging.  Only the Room and Cluster symbol properties
      will be read for the purpose of user designated packaging.  Use with
      the -y option if back annotation to the Common DataBase is not desired.

     The cross mapping of symbol pin names to Vendor Part Number pin
      numbers will be checked for packaged symbols and mapped correctly
      for unpackaged symbols.

     Unable to determine the AllowAlphaRefDes status.
     !Reference designators that do not contain digits will be
      deleted and the relevant symbols will be repackaged!

     The FLATNETNAMEs status indicates that the present set
      of schematic netnames should be used to update the
      FLATNETNAMEs.

     PDB properties found in the PDB_Property_Configuration file will
      be transferred to unpackaged symbols only.
     The following PDB properties will be copied to the CDB to update symbols:
       "IBIS"
       "Verilog Model"
       "VHDL Model"
       "Simulation model"
       "Value"
       "Model Suffix"

     WARNING:  The schematic source files have been modified since
      the present Common DataBase was compiled.  Please have the
      schematic designer recompile the CDB and rerun this procedure
      if it is desired to incorporate the latest changes.

     Checking the validity of the packaging of prepackaged schematic
      symbols.  Only the first error in symbols having the same
      Reference Designator will be reported.

     The packaging of all prepackaged schematic symbols is consistant
      with the Parts DataBase data for the cross mapping of
      symbol pin names to Vendor Part Number pin numbers.
      Symbols that were not prepackaged will now be packaged correctly.
      
      No errors in Existing Schematic Packaging.


     The Common DataBase has been read and will be packaged.

     Updating the Common DataBase

     A BAM WasIs List: bamwasis.bam has been created.
     There have been 6 reference designator changes.
     WARNING:  If the Net Properties dialog has net ordering
      data in it, the relevant reference designator/pin
      number changes will need to be hand edited in the dialog or
      the net ordering plus any delay formula data will be lost
      where discrepancies occur upon forward annotation to VBPCB.
      However, do NOT make these changes unless and until the Common
      DataBase has been updated.
     The BAM file will list all of the from-to changes.

     The Common DataBase has been successfully updated.
